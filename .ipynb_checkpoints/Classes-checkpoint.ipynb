    "1. With the help of Classes we can easily represent complex data structures and they contain functions that then describe the behavior of our class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A class is basically a blueprint of how something should be defined and the way we create class in python is with the keyword class and then followed by a name by convention we start the class name with a capital letter.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Class is just a blueprint it does not contains any concrete information the actual informations will be on the instances of that class. for example if you create a dogs class, the class will contains only the outline or general information like colors,breed,height,weight. But in the instance it will consist what the actual breed like gernansherped and color like black.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. All classes have a function called __init__(), which is always executed when the class is being initiated.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Use the __init__() function to assign values to object properties, or other operations that are necessary to do when the object is being created:\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The __init__() function is called automatically every time the class is being used to create a new object.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belongs to the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. It does not have to be named self , you can call it whatever you like, but it has to be the first parameter of any function in the class:\n",
